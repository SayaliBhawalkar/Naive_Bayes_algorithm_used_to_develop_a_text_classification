# problem statement
A company is looking to develop a text classification model to 
categorize customer reviews into positive or negative sentimants 
They want to use Naive bayes classification to automatically analyze
and classify the review they receive, aiming to understand customer
satisfaction levels and sentiments. the company desires a model that can accurately 
predict whether a customer review expresses a positive or negative sentimant.

The company has chosen to use the Naive Bayes classification algorithm for this task due to its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification problems. The model will serve as a tool to:

.Analyze customer reviews efficiently.

.Provide actionable insights into customer sentiments.

.Enable data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction.

The key requirements are:

1.A well-trained and optimized Naive Bayes model.

2.Accurate sentiment prediction for customer reviews.

3.A system that can handle a diverse range of review texts.
